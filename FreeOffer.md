Since version 2020.2 the plugin is changed to a paid version. Previous versions are still available for free, but further updates will only be available on the Paid Version.

FREE or discount provided: this latest paid version plugin provides the same offer as Jetbrains' <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students">Special Offers</a>, so For students and teachers, For classroom assistance, For Open Source projects, it's free.
