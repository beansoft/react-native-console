  Welcome and thank you for using BeanSoft's React Native Console (“**RNConsole**”, “**we**”)! RNConsole enables users to be more efficient and productive in working with the React Native codes and commands. These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”), along with our DMCA Policy, Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy (collectively with Terms, the “**Agreement**”), cover your use of and access to our services, software, technology, and support websites (“**Services**”). By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

Due to the current situation, JetBrains and **RNConsole** has suspended sales in Russia and Belarus, meaning that new licenses and renewal purchases are no longer possible for users from these countries. Current JetBrains IDE license holders will be provided with a grace period and fallback license, which has already been communicated to them.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, RNConsole is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.


PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT INCLUDES TERMS REGARDING PRIVACY, FUTURE CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT, FEES, LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES BY ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF IN COURT, AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS.

##### **Software**

Our Services may allow you to download software (“**Software**”) which may update automatically in the Jetbrains Marketplace. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely in connection with the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open-source license, the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.

##### **Beta Services**

We may release products and features that we’re still testing and evaluating (“**Beta Services**”). Beta Services are labeled "eap", “alpha,” “beta,” “preview,” “early access,” or “evaluation” (or with words or phrases with similar meanings). Beta Services may not be as reliable as RNConsole stable version and may be changed at any time without notice. By using our Beta Services, you agree that we may contact you to collect your feedback.

Beta Services are used at your own risk. If you do not agree to the Terms in this section, please do not use our Beta Services.

##### **Copyright**

The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other Chinese and foreign laws. This Agreement does not grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, any related technology including related data object structures, architectures, and models, others’ content in the Services, logos, and other brand features. We welcome feedback, comments, ideas, and suggestions, but please note that these may be used without any obligation to you, and all feedback, comments, ideas, and suggestions related to the Services, or any of RNConsole's other products or services, shall be owned by RNConsole.

###### We require that you respect the intellectual property rights of third parties. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our DMCA Policy. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement for the Services is:

##### **Paid Version**

You may use paid features to your RNConsole plugin(resulting in a “**Paid Version**”). We’ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Version and on each periodic renewal until cancellation of your Paid Account, and the paid account and paid method are provided by the Jetbrains Inc. If you do not timely pay for your Paid Account, we reserve the right to suspend it or remove Paid Version features. RNConsole may change the fees in effect on Paid Version at any time in our sole discretion but will give you reasonable advance notice of these changes via plugin notification. You’re responsible for all applicable taxes on Paid Version.

Your Paid Version will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under this Agreement. You may cancel your RNConsole Paid Version any time. Refunds are only issued if required by law or as specifically stated in this Agreement.

##### **Termination**

You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We have the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. RNConsole reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

In the event that your account is terminated by us or you, we will not delete your plugin, but it will be disabled, including any content or data you have provided via the Services.

RNConsole, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT RNConsole OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW, WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20.00 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT OF FEES YOU HAVE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT PLAN WITH RNConsole.

**Indemnification**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to release, indemnify, and hold RNConsole and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and its respective officers, employees, directors, and agents harmless from any from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, rights, claims, and actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Services, your connection to the Services, your violation of this Agreement or your violation of any rights of another. RNConsole reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with RNConsole in asserting any available defenses.

##### **Resolving Disputes**

*Informal Resolution.* Before filing a legal claim against RNConsole, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting [beansoft@126.com](mailto:beansoft@126.com). If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you may bring a formal claim.

*Judicial Forum for Disputes.* Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, you and RNConsole agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to this Agreement or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of Beijing China, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and RNConsole consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS CAREFULLY! THEY MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.**

**U.S. RESIDENTS AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:**

*Agreement to Arbitrate.* You and RNConsole agree to resolve any claims relating to the Agreement or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.

*Arbitration Procedures.* Arbitration is a less formal procedure than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. The American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. AAA’s rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.adr.org&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1626126207232000&usg=AOvVaw2bRsRea34hzv5gZqFK2o55). The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, Ohio, or another mutually agreed-upon location.

*Arbitration Costs.* The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. RNConsole will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines that the claim is frivolous. RNConsole will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that the claim is frivolous.

*Opt-Out Procedure.* YOU CAN REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (“**OPT-OUT**”) BY EMAILING US AT beansoft@126.com WITHIN 30 DAYS OF FIRST REGISTERING YOUR ACCOUNT AND PROVIDING US WITH YOUR NAME, EMAIL ADDRESS, AND A CLEAR STATEMENT SHOWING YOUR INTENT TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, IF YOU AGREED TO A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THESE TERMS THAT ALLOWED YOU TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOUR PREVIOUS CHOICE TO OPT-OUT OR NOT OPT-OUT REMAINS BINDING.

*Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.* Either you or RNConsole may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Ohio or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Ohio to resolve your claim.

*No Class Actions*. YOU AND RNConsole AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS HELD UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE DEEMED VOID.

##### **Controlling Law**

Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, these Terms will be governed by Chinese law without regard to conflict of law provisions.

**Survival**

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification, dispute resolution, controlling law, and limitations of liability.

##### **Entire Agreement**

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and RNConsole with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes and replaces any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, oral or written, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of RNConsole, or by the posting by RNConsole of a revised version. This Agreement creates no third-party beneficiary rights.

##### **Waiver, Severability & Assignment**

RNConsole’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. You may not assign any of your rights under this Agreement, and any such attempt will be void. RNConsole may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

##### **Modifications**

RNConsole reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms at any time and we will update these Terms in the event of any such amendments. We will notify you of material changes to this Agreement via a notification in the Services or by sending email to the primary email address specified in your RNConsole account. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you. If you do not agree to the updates, please cancel your RNConsole account and stop using the Services before the updates become effective. Your continued use of the Services after those 30 days constitutes your agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Services constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms.
